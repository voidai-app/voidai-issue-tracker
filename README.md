# VoidAI Issue Tracker

This repository's purpose is to keep track of VoidAI issues, and bugs. No code will ever be uploaded here. Please don't ask.

# How do I report bugs/issues/etc

If you would like to report a bug, please see the issues tab, do not create a new bug report/issue if there is already one describing the same issue.
